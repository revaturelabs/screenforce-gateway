Contribution guidelines
The master branch holds the most recent stable version of the code vetted by the product owner. Your trainer will make a PR from your batch branch (convention: month and year-trainer name, e.g. 1807-Emily for Emily's batch which began in July 2018) into staging after your iteration.

All branches off your batch branch must be prefixed with your batch's numeric identifier (e.g. 1807). Stray branches will be deleted.

The sledgehammer branch is the product owner's own branch, please do not use this one.
